The goal was to make a tool that generates an image from a color table. Also a system to draw on the image.

To install the project, just download the repository and use the .exe in the folder.

To use : 
* 2 generating buttons, one with all color and an other with only the light colors of the first one.
* 2 counter, the first for the height of the image, the second for the width.
* A save button with a path enter and a file name enter. If u let the path and file name blank, a ``.png`` file will be created a the root of the disk.
* Right click on the image to change the current color of the pixel by a black pixel.
* A button to rollback every click you've done on the image.
